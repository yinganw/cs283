        "**Probing** is an interpretability technique to understand what information is encoded in different layers of a neural network. We train simple models (probes) to predict specific targets from the network's internal representations. If a probe can successfully predict a target, it suggests that information is encoded in those representations. Note that when training probes, the aim is to not maximize on accuracy but reflect the true information content in features, and hence you should not overparameterize your classifier.\n",

You'll load pre-computed Hubert features and corresponding phone labels for each layer (0-12), then train a simple 2-layer neural network classifier to predict phone categories from these features. Your goal is to investigate whether different layers of the model contain varying amounts of phonetic information, and if so, how this information is distributed across the model's depth."

        "\n",
        "**Objective**: Train a regressor to predict MFCC features from Hubert features. This tests how well each layer captures **acoustic information**.\n",
        "\n",
        "**What are MFCC Features?**\n",
        "\n",
        "**MFCC (Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients)** are acoustic features that capture the spectral characteristics of speech. MFCCs are computed by:\n",
        "1. **Windowing** the audio signal into short frames (typically 25ms)\n",
        "2. **Computing FFT** to get frequency spectrum\n",
        "3. **Mel-scale filtering** to simulate human auditory perception\n",
        "4. **Log transformation** to compress dynamic range\n",
        "5. **DCT (Discrete Cosine Transform)** to decorrelate coefficients\n",
        "\n",
        "The 13 MFCC coefficients capture different aspects of the acoustic signal, with lower coefficients representing broader spectral characteristics and higher coefficients capturing finer details.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Task Overview**: In this task, you will implement an **MFCC regression probe** to understand how acoustic information is encoded across different layers of the Hubert model. You'll load pre-computed Hubert features and corresponding MFCC labels for each layer (0-12), then train a regression probe using the previously defined probe to predict 13 MFCC coefficients from these features. Your goal is to investigate whether different layers of the model contain varying amounts of acoustic information, and if so, how this information is distributed across the model's depth. You'll train separate regressors for each of the 13 layers, evaluate them on held-out test sets using R² scores, and analyze the results to understand what Hubert has learned about acoustic properties at each stage of processing."

You will extract audio features from 20 speakers and compute mean-pooled Hubert features from for each layer, and use t-SNE dimensionality reduction to visualize how well different layers separate speakers in the feature space. Your goal is to investigate whether different layers of the model contain varying amounts of speaker information, and if so, how this information is distributed across the model's depth. You'll analyze t-SNE plots for all 13 layers to understand how Hubert's internal representations evolve from speaker-agnostic to speaker-specific information. This experiment will help you understand how Hubert balances linguistic content with speaker identity across its layers.\n"
